# Shopify Order Print System
## Project Planning Document

### Project Overview
The Shopify Order Print System is a Windows desktop application designed to streamline the order fulfillment process by automatically generating and printing pick tickets and other order-related documents from Shopify orders. The application will be built using Python with a native Windows interface, making it easy to deploy and maintain across multiple workstations.

### Core Requirements

#### Functional Requirements
1. **Authentication & Setup**
   - First-time setup wizard for Shopify API credentials
   - Secure storage of authentication tokens

2. **Order Management**
   - Fetch orders from Shopify that are not tagged as "printed" of fetch orders by date range (GraphQL Query)
   - Display orders in a sortable table view
   - Support for bulk selection of orders
   - Automatic order tagging after printing (optional checkbox, tag as "printed" -- GraphQL mutation)

3. **Document Generation**
   - Generate pick tickets in PDF format
   - One order per page
   - Include all relevant order details:
     - Order number
     - Customer information
     - Line items with quantities
     - SKUs
     - Inventory locations
   - Support for additional document templates (future capability)

4. **Printing**
   - Native Windows print dialog integration
   - Batch printing support
   - Print preview capability
   - Default printer selection

#### Technical Requirements
1. **Development**
   - Python 3.x
   - PySide6 for GUI
   - WeasyPrint for PDF generation from HTML/CSS templates
   - Jinja2 for HTML templating
   - Shopify GraphQL API integration
   - Git version control + GitHub

2. **Deployment**
   - Compiled executable (.exe)
   - Simple installation process
   - Minimal dependencies
   - Support for Windows 10/11 & Linux

   - Support for multipage page layouts

2. **Key Features**
   - Live template preview
   - Custom CSS for different doc types
   - Print Optimizations
   - Page break controls
   - Layouts for 8.5x11 paper

3. **Template Management**
   - Version Controlled Templates
   - Easy template modification
   - Style Inheritence
   - Component reusability

### Risk Assessment

1. **Technical Risks**
   - Shopify API changes
   - Printer compatibility issues
   - PDF generation performance
   
2. **Mitigation Strategies**
   - Version control for API integration
   - Extensive printer testing
